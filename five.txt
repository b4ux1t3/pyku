But when I wake up
When will I be free
How can you sit there
Poetry is cool
When God is asleep
Starbucks barista
Beautiful sunset
Only games of chance
Make the leap, do it
Imagination
Without help you can
I wear a fez now
I can't find my shoes
I will come for you
In the lion's den
Over the rainbow
Everytime we touch
Fantastic places
A heavenly sin
Without you I am
With you I am not
Laughter kills slowly
Call out from within
