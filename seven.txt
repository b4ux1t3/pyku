I cannot help but wonder
Oh my god giant lobster
Yes, I do poetry now
Achievement is not easy
Inspired design every day
Not only the just can win
Batman Superman Robin
Farewell to the rum and coke
Occasionally cheerful
Angry bees with flamethrowers
From the mist comes evidence
When we all have our daring
Soft Rabbit fur is evil
Seek satisfaction elsewhere
Visualized fantasy
Even the lonliest have
Love is where the mind fails you
Sheets of linen in the spring
Icy hearts want not for love
Sexual desire is sin
Set sail to your horizon
Navigate by sight alone
